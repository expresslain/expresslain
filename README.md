### Welcome! ðŸ‘‹  
I'm an IT Project Manager who believes that understanding code and keeping up with continuous learning is essential for leading successful technology projects. While my primary focus is on delivering value, managing teams, and ensuring projects run smoothly, I also enjoy rolling up my sleeves and writing some Python when needed.

### Why Code as a Project Manager?
**Empathy:** Understanding the challenges developers face.

**Communication:** Bridging the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Problem Solving:** Quickly prototyping solutions or troubleshooting issues.

**Continuous Learning:** Staying current with technology trends.

## About This Repository

This repo is a collection of my simple Python scripts and notes that I use to stay sharp with coding fundamentals. I believe that hands-on experience with code helps me communicate better with developers, estimate tasks more accurately, and make informed decisions.
